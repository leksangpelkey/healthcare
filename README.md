Stroke prediction dataset

As per the WHO (World Health Organization) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of dead globally.

This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient. There are a total of 11 clinical features for predicting stroke events

Also, I am looking to find the answer for following question:

Who is likely to get stroke male, female?
Does age play a role in getting stroke?
Do children get stroke?
What is average glucose level for patients with stroke?
Does smoking has influence in getting stroke?
Does work_type predict stroke?
Does residence type predict stroke?
